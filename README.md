## About this project:   
Searching, sorting and traversal algorithms are key concepts most programmers are at least familiar with.       

This project aims to:  
1. Show every individual step and algorithm does to solve a problem
2. Present a GUI that's easily understandable and navigable  
3. Present several different algorithms a user can choose from 
4. Give users several options to see how different arrays and trees affect an algorithms performance
6. Allow users to control how fast an algorithm solves a problem
